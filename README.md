# ManagedBlockchain-AWSCLOUDPROVIDER-

Welcome to the AWS Managed Blockchain Project! This project aims to provide an easy way to set up and manage a blockchain network using Amazon Web Services (AWS).

Features
Quickly set up a secure blockchain network using popular open-source frameworks such as Hyperledger Fabric and Ethereum.
Easily invite new members to join the network and manage permissions using AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM).
Scale the number of nodes in the network up or down as needed using AWS Auto Scaling.
Monitor the health and performance of the network using Amazon CloudWatch.
Pay only for the resources you use with the AWS pay-as-you-go pricing model.
Getting Started

Navigate to the AWS Managed Blockchain dashboard and create a new network.
Choose the blockchain framework (Hyperledger Fabric or Ethereum), the member and node configuration, and any other relevant options.
Click "Create Network" to set up the blockchain network.
